## [Unreleased]

- No unreleased changes.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Initial standalone release of a production-oriented **agent governance control plane**.
- Core control plane engines:
  - `PolicyEngine` for risk tiering and policy evaluation.
  - `ProposalRouter` for deterministic routing and auditable routing decisions.
  - `ApprovalGate` for ticket lifecycle, scoped approvals, and expiry handling.
  - `BudgetTracker` with atomic session budget enforcement.
- `ConcurrencyGuard` to serialize overlapping work per session/resource.
  - `KillSwitch` for session/system/budget emergency stop semantics.
  - `SessionManager` for session lifecycle and policy snapshot persistence.
  - `EventStore` with per-session monotonic sequence numbering, fail-closed semantics for state-bearing writes, and buffering for non-state-bearing telemetry writes.
- Recovery handlers:
  - `CrashRecovery` for active-cycle recovery after process interruption.
  - `TimeoutEscalation` for stuck-cycle detection and escalation.
- Integration primitives:
  - `ModelRegistry` and SQLAlchemy mixins for host-application model composition.
  - Typed DTOs and enums for approvals, proposals, sessions, events, and policy definitions.
- Policy and classification features:
  - Pluggable `RiskClassifier` protocol and `DefaultRiskClassifier`.
  - Generic proposal scoring fields (`weight`, `score`) and resource-scoped approvals (`resource_id`, `scope_resource_ids`).
  - Generic execution parameters via `ExecutionIntentDTO.parameters`.
- Developer and adoption assets:
  - `examples/quickstart.py` with a runnable SQLite control-flow walkthrough.
- Test coverage:
  - Added regression tests for approval scope behavior, timeout escalation, and event buffering/failure handling.

### Changed

- Control-plane behavior is documented in terms of explicit governance versus execution separation.
- Failure semantics were clarified and aligned across engine boundaries for safer failure handling.
- Public docs and architecture references were expanded for external integration use.
- Public terminology and API names are domain-agnostic for multi-domain agent workloads.

### Documentation

- Added `README.md` quickstart and architecture framing for autonomous-agent control-plane usage.
- Added `docs/architecture.md` with:
  - Component map.
  - Control-plane lifecycle sequence.
  - Public API matrix.
  - Release-readiness checklist.
  - Operational gotchas and anti-patterns.

### Known Limitations

- This release intentionally excludes execution-plane implementations (tool callers, action adapters, and service connectors); those are expected to be supplied by host applications.
